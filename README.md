# Screen Share-example

This is the source code for a very simple Screen share with mouse control example

Note: tested en windows only, also had to manually download ffmpeg.exe and replace the one from the npm library 'fmpeg-static' due to missing encoders
also, to install you need to run 'npm install -g windows-build-tools'
